my collections of bookmarklets
http://www.lab4games.net/zz85/blog

=== What are they? ===
Bookmarklets are javascript code that can be run from a bookmarklet or in the URL. It adds functionality to sites you visit in your browser without the need for add-ons or plugins installations.

=== List of Bookmarklets ===
SimplePad
javascript:document.write('<script src="https://github.com/zz85/zz85-bookmarklets/raw/master/js/simplepad.js"></script>');

Vimeo HD Video Downloader
javascript:(function(){var script=document.createElement('script');script.type='text/javascript';script.src='https://github.com/zz85/zz85-bookmarklets/raw/master/js/vimeo.js';document.body.appendChild(script);})()

=== Ideas to be implemented ====
- extra minimal + offline + compressed javascript bookmarklet formats
- dynamic zz85 bookmarklet directory


=== Project directory ===
Its a little messy in here, so head in only if you know what you're doing
/js - where i store my latest javascript bookmarklets
/experiments - where i test my ideas and scripts
